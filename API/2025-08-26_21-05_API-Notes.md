# API Learning Notes (Roman Urdu) – Detailed Study

## What is an API?
API stands for **Application Programming Interface**. It is a set of rules that allows two software applications to communicate with each other. I can think of it like a waiter in a restaurant: the customer (app) gives an order, the waiter (API) takes it to the kitchen (server), and then brings the food (data) back to the customer. In the same way, APIs help different systems exchange data or functionality.

### Example:
When I use a weather app, it sends a request to a weather API, and the API returns the current weather data.

## Types of APIs
1. **REST API**  
    - Most commonly used type of API.
    - Uses HTTP methods: `GET` (fetch data), `POST` (send data), `PUT` (update data), `DELETE` (remove data).
    - Data is usually in JSON format.
    - **Example:**  
      ```
      GET https://api.example.com/users
      ```
      This request will return a list of users.

2. **SOAP API**  
    - Uses XML format.
    - Has strict rules and higher security.
    - More complex, often used in banking or enterprise systems.
    - **Example:**  
      ```
      <soap:Envelope>
         <soap:Body>
            <GetUserDetails>...</GetUserDetails>
         </soap:Body>
      </soap:Envelope>
      ```

3. **GraphQL API**  
    - Allows flexible queries, so I get only the data I need.
    - Has a single endpoint, but I can specify exactly what data I want.
    - **Example:**  
      ```
      {
         user(id: 1) {
            name
            email
         }
      }
      ```

## How Does an API Work?
- The client (like a mobile app or browser) sends a request to the API.
- The API processes the request, fetches data from the server, and sends it back to the client.
- This process usually happens over the internet.

### Example:
If I send a `GET /products` request from my app, the API will return a list of products.

---

## API Endpoints
API endpoints are specific URLs where I send my requests.

- `/users` – List of users
- `/products` – List of products
- `/orders/123` – Details of order number 123

### Example:
```
GET https://api.example.com/products/5
```
This request will return details of product with ID 5.

## API Documentation
API documentation is a guide where I can find:
- List of endpoints
- Methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- Required parameters
- Response format
- Example requests and responses

### Example:
```
Endpoint: /users
Method: GET
Description: Returns a list of all users.
Response: [{"id":1,"name":"Ali"}, ...]
```

---

## How to Use an API
1. **Send a request:** Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
2. **Write the URL:** Enter the API endpoint address.
3. **Headers/Body:** Send necessary data or authentication (like API key).
4. **Response:** Receive data from the server (usually in JSON format).

### Example:
```
GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Lahore&appid=API_KEY
```
This request will give me the weather data for Lahore.

---

## Pro Tips
- **Authentication:** Use tokens or API keys to keep the API secure.
- **Error Handling:** Always check the response status code (200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server error).
- **Rate Limiting:** Don’t send too many requests, or the API might temporarily block me.
- **Testing Tools:** Use Postman or Insomnia to test API requests.

### Example:
If the API returns a 401 status code, it means there is an authentication issue (API key is wrong or missing).

## Practice
- Practice with free APIs like:
  - [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
  - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Try building a simple API myself, for example using Node.js and Express to create a `/hello` endpoint.
